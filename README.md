This program simulates ants' behavior ofcreating trails by their communicating with each other via 2 types of pheromones. When you run this program, you will see three boxes on top and three bars at bottom.
 
The Left box shows the ants' movement. The middle and the right one will show the distribution of eventual distributions of two pheromones after the simulation is done.

The bars at the bottom represents the progress of overall simulation, ratio of three modes of ants alive, and the probability that ants came back so far from top to bottom.

When all the procedures end, this program will spit out a csv file that shows stores information of the setting, and the probability of ants' coming back to the nest.

Enjoy seeing the process that ants create their trail!!
