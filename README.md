This program simulates ants' behavior of creating trails by communicating with each other via 2 types of pheromones. After you run this program, you will see three boxes on top and three bars at bottom.
 
The Left box shows the ants' movement. The middle and the right one show the eventual distributions of two pheromones after the whole simulation.

The bars at the bottom represents the progress of overall simulation, ratio of three modes of ants, and the cummulative probability that ants came back so far from top to bottom.

When all the procedures end, this program will spit out a csv file with information of the setting, and the probability of ants' that came back to the nest.

Enjoy seeing the process that ants create their trail!!
